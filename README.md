2.  **Access the Webpage:**

    Due to potential browser security restrictions when fetching local files (e.g., `file://` protocol limitations), it is highly recommended to serve the project using a local web server.

    **Recommended Method (Using a Local Web Server):**

    *   **Using Python's Built-in HTTP Server:**
        If you have Python installed, you can easily start a simple web server:
        ```bash
        python -m http.server
        # Or for Python 2:
        # python -m SimpleHTTPServer
        ```
        After running this command, open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8000` (or the port indicated by the server).

    *   **Using `serve` (Node.js):**
        If you have Node.js installed, you can use the `serve` package:
        ```bash
        npx serve .
        # Or if you've installed it globally:
        # serve .
